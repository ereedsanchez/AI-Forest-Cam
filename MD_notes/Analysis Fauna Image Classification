The goal being discussed in the article is to create an animal picture classifier that can be used in deep forest areas. The goal of this project is to classify animal photographs accurately, which will be very helpful to researchers studying neural networks, artificial intelligence, and zoology. The objective of the classifier is to accelerate research, optimize monitoring systems, and advance environmental, extinction patterns, and habitat analysis.
The project tackles the labor-intensive and costly problem of manually processing a huge number of photos and movies from camera traps. To effectively classify animal photos, they employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), more precisely the VGG16 architecture. The project also addresses disparities in posture, background, lighting, and environment, as well as class inequality.
Several processes are involved in the project's design and analysis, including feature development using the VGG16 model, data preparation, load, assessment, instruction, and verification. They address problems associated with "Dying ReLU" by utilizing a Leaky ReLU activation mechanism. Following the model's training, its effectiveness is assessed using a confusion matrix, classification metrics, training and validation accuracy and loss graphs, and more.

In order to maximize feature compression, the implementation calls for the creation of a bottleneck file and the import of the appropriate libraries. They load a pre-trained VGG16 model, define epoch and batch sizes, and divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
The VGG16 model is used to generate weights and features that optimize the neural network. There is a discussion of the training procedure, which includes the use of sequential models, data flattening, hidden layer addition, and dropout to prevent overfitting.
In order to assess model performance, the paper also stresses the significance of creating a confusion matrix, classification metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score), and visualizing training and validation accuracy and loss for each epoch.
They conclude by talking about the testing stage, which involves using a sample image to test a trained model and make sure it correctly classifies images. The outcomes demonstrate that the model successfully distinguished between animal photos with various backgrounds and variants with a high degree of accuracy.
The study was carried out on the Animal-10 dataset, which consists of 26,179 photos from 10 animal types, using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The model's classification accuracy for individual animal photos was an impressive 99.89%, while its accuracy for six animal classifications was 91.84%. The project details and code are published as open-source on GitHub.
