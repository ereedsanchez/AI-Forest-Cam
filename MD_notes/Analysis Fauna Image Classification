The goal being discussed in the article is to create an animal picture classifier that can be used in deep forest areas. The goal of this project is to classify animal photographs accurately, which will be very helpful to researchers studying neural networks, artificial intelligence, and zoology. The objective of the classifier is to accelerate research, optimize monitoring systems, and advance environmental, extinction patterns, and habitat analysis.
The project tackles the labor-intensive and costly problem of manually processing a huge number of photos and movies from camera traps. To effectively classify animal photos, they employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), more precisely the VGG16 architecture. The project also addresses disparities in posture, background, lighting, and environment, as well as class inequality.
Several processes are involved in the project's design and analysis, including feature development using the VGG16 model, data preparation, load, assessment, instruction, and verification. They address problems associated with "Dying ReLU" by utilizing a Leaky ReLU activation mechanism. Following the model's training, its effectiveness is assessed using a confusion matrix, classification metrics, training and validation accuracy and loss graphs, and more.
